## The Problem
This client was a referral from a previous client. He had built his own site when he first started his accounting business. After some success, he wanted a more professional look on his company website.

## Website: Before Photo

export default (props) => <ArticleLayout meta={meta} {...props} />

## Project Background

I knew that to get it right I was going to have to help him with just about every facet of the new site. He needed adjustments to colors, branding, information architechture, and even the platform the site was built on.

## How I helped

1. Logo design
2. Information architechture
3. Website design
4. Website development
5. DNS management
6. Email deliverability

## Changing Platforms

This client had used GoDaddy's proprietary Website Builder software, but over time, was bumping into the limitations of that software. While we can do a much more robust setup for the right client, the project requirements for this one dictated a much simple WordPress build.

## The re-brand

Idem se saxa fata pollentibus geminos; quos pedibus. Est urnis Herses omnes nec

1. Captus inpleverunt collo
2. Nec nam placebant

4. Dictis carissime fugae
5. A tacitos nulla viginti
